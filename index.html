	Welcome to my Wev Dev Portfolio. My name is Brian, and I'm a Systems Administrator who loves writing hacky scripts and working on home lab projects. I've jumped around in the technology field from <em><b>Network Operations -> Systems Administration -> Network Engineering -> Data Center Operations</b></em>. Outside of technology, I enjoy hiking, biking, running, and exploring.
