					<h1>OpenVPN Server</h1>
					<h2>02/06/2018</h2>
					<p>This Monday we got our SSL VPN on x2. We setup OpenVPN Access Server on top of CentOS 7 and in Untangle. OpenVPN AS is a super friendly way to VPN into your house while out and about. From Android to iOS and Mac to Windows, OpenVPN has a client for you with plenty of third party options as well.</p>

					<h1>Mobile Cart Build</h1>
					<h2>01/30/2018</h2>
					<p>We had a productive meeting last night even if it was light on technology. Thanks to all who showed up; we're setting ourselves up for easier meetings and sustainable systems. Thanks to Cory, Kevin (Drew), Brian, and Kyle for help with assembling the server cart. We can now roll into any space with a network jack and power outlet and get up and running in seconds. Thanks to Cory and Andrew for help with getting the first Tower of Turczak online and setup with a copy of ESXi that will stay in place. Finally, thanks to all those who donated equipment to the cause as well. Brian for NICs and an additional i5 box.</p>
