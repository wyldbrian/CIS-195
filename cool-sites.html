<h2>Strava</h2>

<p>
Strava's initial landing page has a simple smooth layout. The page explains what type of product they're offering and some of its features. As you scroll down through the page to the bottom, you get a good idea of what they're application can do. Additionally, as an added bonus, Strava offers a free API that will allow you pull down detailed stats for review.

<h2>Github</h2>

I really enjoy viewing code on Github due to its awesome layout. While the primary audience is developers, Github provides a friendly interface that's relatively easy to understand. Furthermore, they make it welcoming by adding help features for people who may be new to using code repositories.
